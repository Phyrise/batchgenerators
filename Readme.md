# batchgenerators_translation [In Progress]
This repository adapts the batchgenerators for image-to-image translation tasks. It is based on the original repository found at [MIC-DKFZ/batchgenerators](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/batchgenerators).

## Changes Made
- **Spatial transforms** : updated to support input (img, img) instead of (img, seg)
    
## TODO
- More testing on the changes made
- Think about mirror augmentation
